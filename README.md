# Lab 2 - 90803

---

For this Lab you will need to do the following:

1. Git clone your repo to your local machine (look back at Lab 1 if you have any doubts), using the SSH connection.
2. Open the `Lab2_S23_YourNameHere` jupyter notebook and work through it.
3. It is advisable to work on different branches and at the end merge your branches to `main`.
4. Periodically go back to the terminal to commit your changes to your Jupyter Notebook. Do not wait until the end, make sure to do commit for at least every question in the notebook. Remember that doing a commit involves:
	-  Making changes to your jupyter notebook
	-  Adding changes to your staging area (`git add`)
	-  Committing, with a descriptive message of the task you are committing (`git commit -m "descriptive message"`).
	-  Add a gitignore `git add .gitignore` - for the files you want the commit to ignore. For example, in MacOS you might want to ignore `.DS_Store`. Add this to your gitignore `echo .DS_Store >> .gitignore`. Other files that you might want to include here are `ipynb_checkpoints/*`.
	-  Here are some links if you want to read more on [ipynb checkpoints](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46421663/what-are-jupyter-notebook-checkpoint-files-for) or how to [gitignore](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35916658/how-to-git-ignore-ipython-notebook-checkpoints-anywhere-in-repository) them.
5. When you are ready to push back to your GitHub remote repo make sure to:
	- Have any branches merged into `main`
	- `git push origin main`
	- Have your passphrase at hand

6. Once you have pushed to GitHub, then got over to Gradescope and submit your repo (it will only take your `main` branch). Your code will run and a score will appear on Gradescope. Bare in mind that this score will be a maximum of 2/4. The other 2 points will be entered manually after we enter the attendance sheet.
